# Wifi password grabber using python

Whenever a device connects to a wireless network,its operating system stores the password used for establishing connection in its memory for further reference. Python provides some amazing modules by which we can directly interact with our operating system and obtain all these informatio from the memory. So the code which is attached with this project helps us obtaining all these information. So download it and run it on friends computer and obtain passwords for all the wifi connection he/she has connected till now. __This tutorial is done only for education purpose. So if user involves in any unethical activities, this channel will not be responsible for it.__
